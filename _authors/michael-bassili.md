raw_description: "\"We drive as fast as road designs tell us to drive. The result: drivers kill four times as many pedestrians on spacious suburban residential streets than on the narrow streets of traditional neighborhoods, because those spacious roads make driving faster feel safer. And it is not collisions that kill people, but collisions at high speed.\" — Charles Montgomery, Happy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design"
