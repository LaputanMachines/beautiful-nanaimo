I'm a software developer and passionate urbanist living in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. I love Nanaimo and want to help shape it into a financially resilient, safe, and beautiful city. I believe that incremental changes in the kinds of infrastructure we build and support are enough to change lives. Decades of auto-oriented development prioritized vehicles over people, leading to dangerous and unpleasant urban infrastructure. We started Strong Towns Nanaimo to advocate and educate, and weâ€™re excited to watch our city grow!
