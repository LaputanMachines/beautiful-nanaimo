Olivia is a lifelong cyclist and transit-lover! 
A career in the trades helped her realize that the built environment is something we all take for granted. After moving to Nanaimo, she co-founded Strong Towns Nanaimo with Michael to help educate the public on the complexities and issues of municipalities in BC. Olivia’s a die-hard advocate for cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, and she’s excited for the future of the Harbour City.
