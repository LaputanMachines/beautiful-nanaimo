Founder of Patchwork Ecosystem Consulting, Zack has spent more than ten years studying regenerative land practices in both urban and rural environments.  With a Diploma in Organic Land Care from RRU and a Permaculture Designer's Certificate from OSU, his current goal is to integrate permaculture-informed design with civic infrastructure, with key strategies around stormwater management, microclimate regulation, and support for native biodiversity â€” all of which make our cities more livable and resilient to the impacts of climate change.
