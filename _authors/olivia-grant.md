I’m a business student attending VIU. Nanaimo already has some excellent urban infrastructure. I’m excited to watch the Harbour City grow and evolve in the years to come. I believe most people want the same thing: a beautiful city. Conflicts can often be resolved with a quick chat – I want Strong Towns Nanaimo to help inform people of the negatives of auto-oriented development so that we can transform our city into a financially resilient and pleasant city.
