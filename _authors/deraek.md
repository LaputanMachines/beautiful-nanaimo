Possessing a deep love for all living things, biology was a natural career choice for Deraek. Through his many years working as a biologist, he witnessed first hand the near complete disregard our political system has unfortunately had for the findings of environmental scientists. A life in politics taught him the importance of the built environment. Important not only in our global pursuit to live ecologically, but in building happier and more productive lives for those living within it.
