Possessing a deep love for all living things, biology was a natural career choice for Deraek. 
Through his many years working as a biologist, he witnessed first hand the near complete disregard our political system has unfortunately had for the findings of environmental scientists. 
With a passionate belief that a better world is possible, Deraek switched career paths to pursue change-making. 
Having now worked on many political and activist campaigns demanding action for the ailing environment we all depend on, he eventually learned how important the built environment is. 
Important not only in our global pursuit to live ecologically, but in building happier and more productive lives for those living within it. 
He is currently studying at VIU with aspirations to join the planning profession
