A former Northern BC resident, Lainy moved to Nanaimo to complete the Master of Community Planning program at VIU with the intention of putting down roots. 8 years later, she has nurtured a network of personal and professional connections throughout the City, and is proud to be part of a caring and diverse community. Her career as a Planner has taken her through public service roles with the City and Regional District of Nanaimo, and has enabled her to gain a deep understanding of how cities work. She has taken a special interest in transportation networks and has become a strong advocate for active and sustainable modes. Lainy's goal is to help foster a culture that is supportive of transit, cycling, and walkable neighbourhoods.
