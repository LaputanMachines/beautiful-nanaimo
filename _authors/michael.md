Emboldened by Nanaimo’s new OCP, Michael and Olivia started Strong Towns Nanaimo to advocate for new urbanism in the Harbour City. 
Born in Ottawa, raised in Vancouver, and married in Mackenzie; Michael’s travels landed him in Nanaimo, eager to advocate for a resilient, empowered, and financially-secure city. 
At his core, Michael wants to see a connected, healthy Nanaimo where people have abundant transportation options and affordable housing.
