## More Homes Canada <a class="partner-link" href="https://more-homes.vercel.app/" target="_blank"><sup><i class="ion ion-md-exit"></i></sup></a>

More Homes Canada is a coalition of local housing advocacy groups. Together, we are fighting to end Canada’s housing shortage. Across Canada, municipal governments have made it incredibly difficult to build higher density housing. We'll need a lot of new homes to end the housing crisis, and the first step is to get out of our own way.
