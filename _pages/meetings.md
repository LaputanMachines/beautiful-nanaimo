We try to organize events to raise awareness of Strong Towns principles and engage with the community. Itâ€™s always a treat to collaborate with other urbanists in Nanaimo who want the city to grow sustainably. **Meeting invitations are sent via our mailing list (sign up below) and are either held remotely or in-person.** Bring your friends!
