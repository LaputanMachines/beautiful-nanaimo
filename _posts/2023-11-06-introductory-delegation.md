We'll meet at the Shaw Auditorium roughly ten minutes before the meeting begins.
When we're called up, those who are comfortable can approach the podium with the speaker.

__The slides shown above were used in our delegation to Mayor and Council.__ Our core message is that Nanaimo should be building a Strong Town for people, not cars. We advocate for a shift in our city's priorities towards building a more affordable, equitable, and sustainable Nanaimo.
