Come and grab a drink with other Strong Towns Nanaimo members. We'll discuss our upcoming delegation presentation to Mayor and Council on November 6th. Last meeting, we talked about our high-level goals and ambitions as a group, as well as outlined some short and long-term goals. We've begin working on our presentation (see: Discord).

- 2:00 pm: Meet at the Vault Cafe Downtown
- 4:00 pm: End of scheduled monthly meeting

_We have reserved the long table at the front of the cafe. Look for the Strong Towns Nanaimo signs._ Tell your friends and family! We hope to see you all there!
