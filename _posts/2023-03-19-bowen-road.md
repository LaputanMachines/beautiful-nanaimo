Bowen Road connects Downtown Nanaimo to North Nanaimo via almost 7km of stroad. What is a stroad, you ask? Excellent question: a **stroad** is a combination of a street and a road. A road is a connection from point A to point B. Roads are really good at moving people quickly. You can think of roads as a replacement of railroads, [as Charles Marohn put it](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad). Streets, on the other hand, are profit-generating places where people go to spend time. The classic example of a street is Commercial Street Downtown. People rarely use Commercial to get places – Commercial Street is the destination. A stroad is a hybrid of the two. Unfortunately, stroads fail in both being a way to get from A to B quickly and they fail to act as destinations for people.

Lanes are wide enough to facilitate high-speed driving but the driveway cutouts every few meters prevent higher speeds from feeling comfortable. Pulling your car into one of the many parking lots dotted along Bowen Road means making a dangerous hairpin turn. Pedestrians have it worse – have you ever wondered why you never see pedestrians walking along Bowen Road? The narrow sidewalk presses you tight up against fast-moving vehicles. Crossing driveway cutouts is incredibly dangerous as those nervous drivers from earlier are moving too fast to clearly see and process you, [leading to near-misses and fatalities](https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/nanaimo-rcmp-close-part-of-bowen-road-for-pedestrian-fatality-investigation/). Cyclists are a rarity too. Aside from [a partial section of Bowen that contains a raised cycle lane](https://nanaimonewsnow.com/2020/10/30/major-upgrades-to-bowen-rd-corridor-substantially-complete/), there’s no place for cyclists on the stroad. And, since the raised bike lane disappears after a block, the (excellent) raised cycle lane gets very little use since the road ends as soon as it begins. Check out how many driveways a driver will have to process while cruising down Bowen Road. We’ve highlighted the ones on this two-block stretch.

Places like these aren’t just unpleasant and unsafe. They’re also expensive to build and maintain while simultaneously being financially unproductive. Most notably, Bowen is dangerous. Indeed, [across North America, planners and policymakers are coping with the realization that our post-war auto-oriented developments are killing us](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2022/04/01/our-most-dangerous-streets-huge-new-collision-database-points-to-torontos-postwar-suburbs.html). You can check the data yourself; [use this tool to visualize crash data from ICBC between 2017 and 2021](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/VancouverIslandCrashes/VIDashboard). You can filter the data by city and street.

The people who live, work, and commute through Bowen Road deserve better. Pedestrian safety is non-existent, as there are no valid active transportation options along most of the stroad. Despite connecting Downtown to the E&N Trail, a cyclist can’t safely use Bowen Road to get Downtown. Drivers are forced to make dangerous turns at highway speeds. For those living along Bowen Road and the surrounding neighborhoods, I ask you: _would you feel comfortable letting your kids walk along Bowen Road?_
