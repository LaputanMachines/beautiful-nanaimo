Gear up for the 17th annual Urban Issues Film Festival! This year's theme is 'OasCity.' 
Films will explore the meaning of 'city as oasis,' as a juxtaposition that critically examines crosscutting issues that challenge and enable the city as a metaphorical life sustaining refuge and place of resilience, safety, sanctuary, community and happiness."

Imagine a city as an oasis—a lush, thriving spot of life and hope in the middle of an otherwise harsh environment. 
Just as an oasis brings life to the barren desert, a well-planned, inclusive city can be a sanctuary where every person finds their place, their community, and their sense of belonging. 
Cities have the potential to be more than just places to live; they can be havens of connection, support, and thriving opportunities. 
For cities to become urban oases, we must reimagine our public spaces and social systems. 

* **Time**: 6:00 - 9:00 pm
* **Date**: Friday, November 22nd 2024
* **Price**: Free admission and pizza
* **Location**: VIU Building 356, Room 109

Thriving, inclusive cities prioritize diversity, equity, and belonging. 
They are designed with spaces that encourage human interaction—parks, public squares, and community hubs where people can gather, share experiences, and build relationships. 
Inclusivity means creating environments where all people, regardless of background, can flourish. 
This involves promoting diverse housing options, accessible public services, and safe spaces that foster belonging and connection.
