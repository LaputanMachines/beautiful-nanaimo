It's time to get back to our monthly meetups! 
This time, we'll be meeting at the Vancouver Island Regional Library in downtown Nanaimo.
A lot has happened since our last meetup, and we can't wait to catch up with you all.

* **Time:** 11:00am-1:00pm
* **Date:** Saturday February 8th, 2025
* **Location:** Vancouver Island Regional Library, Downtown Nanaimo

We'll introduce the new executive team, and we'll have a few updates on our ongoing projects.
We also want to hear about what you've been up to, and what you'd like to see from us (and the City) in 2025.
