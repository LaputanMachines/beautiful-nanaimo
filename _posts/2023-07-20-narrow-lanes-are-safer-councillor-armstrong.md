This letter was submitted to the Nanaimo News Bulletin as a direct response to [their article covering the Extension Road traffic calming project](https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/traffic-calming-modifications-coming-to-extension-road-in-south-nanaimo/). Strong Towns mean safe streets for all, including drivers and pedestrians. Traffic calming Extension Road will improve the safety of everyone who lives and commutes through the Cinnabar Valley.

Road safety improvements in town are typically opposed by councillor Sheryl Armstrong. Recently, she expressed concern about the narrowing of Extension Road in the South-End of town. Specifically, Armstrong noted that: “[[narrow roads] don’t reduce accidents, they actually increase it … If you look at where most of the fatals were, they’re where the road is narrower](https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/traffic-calming-modifications-coming-to-extension-road-in-south-nanaimo/).”

This is contrary to BC’s own road safety toolkit, among almost every other publication on road safety published in the last ten years. “Narrower lanes influence drivers’ perception of their margin of error, causing them to slow down.” Moreover, ” Reducing speeds, meanwhile, increases the objective margin of error, while also making crashes less severe
when they do occur”. ([BC Road Safety Toolkit, 7](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/driving-and-transportation/driving/consequences/vision-zero/resource-kit-community-road-safety-toolkit-module2.pdf)) 

The wider the lane, the faster the driver feels they can comfortably drive. The Canadian Association of Road Safety Professionals notes that, “there is a direct correlation between vehicle speed and the likelihood of crash occurrence, seriousness of injury and the odds of a fatality.” ([“Safe Speds”, CARSP](https://carsp.ca/en/news-and-resources/road-safety-information/safe-speeds/)) 

Nanaimo’s own transportation and mobility page even agrees. Notably, “[Controlling driver speed is important; slower vehicles generally mean less chance of an accident, and a smaller chance of injury or death when there is an accident](https://www.nanaimo.ca/transportation-mobility/traffic-calming).” 

Narrow streets exist all around the world, especially outside of car-dominated North America. We’ve over-built our roads in the late 20th century and are grappling with the consequences today. Despite Barbara Thomas’ comment that the “[road design templates accommodate fire trucks and garbage trucks](https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/news/traffic-calming-modifications-coming-to-extension-road-in-south-nanaimo),” Councillor Armstrong was not swayed. 

We suggest Councillor Armstrong reads [Strong Towns by Charles L Marohn Jr](https://www.strongtowns.org/strong-towns-book), or at the very least brush up on her urban planning knowledge.
