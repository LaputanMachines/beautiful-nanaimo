After a brief hiatus, we're back with our monthly meetups! 
This time, we'll be meeting at White Sails Brewing in downtown Nanaimo for a happy hour. 
Come and grab a drink with us, and let's chat about urbanism.

* **Time:** 5:30pm-7:30pm

The executive team has been hard at work finalizing our parking reform proposal, and we'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
