Municipal parking requirements, originally designed to alleviate on-street parking congestion, have led to excessive parking infrastructure that harms the environment, economic vitality, and urban aesthetics while fostering auto-oriented environments at the expense of community-building. 

* **Time:** 7:00pm-8:30pm (Approximate Start Time)
* **Date:** Monday September 9th, 2024
* **Location:** Shaw Auditorium, Downtown Nanaimo

To address these issues, Strong Towns Nanaimo proposes eliminating parking mandates and expanding the cash-in-lieu program to promote sustainable and equitable urban development in Nanaimo.
