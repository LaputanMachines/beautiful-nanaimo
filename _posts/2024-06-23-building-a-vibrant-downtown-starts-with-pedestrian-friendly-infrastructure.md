In response to [the recent op-ed on Terminal Avenue in the newspaper](https://www.nanaimobulletin.com/opinion/letter-to-the-editor-nanaimos-terminal-avenue-lanes-too-narrow-7373717), we would like to present a different perspective on the changes happening Downtown. While concerns about traffic and business impacts are understandable, they come from a lack of understanding business and traffic dynamics. The recent modifications aim to create a safer, more vibrant, and economically resilient downtown for everyone.

Narrowing lanes and adding features like center boulevards with trees and improved sidewalks are proven methods to enhance road safety. Studies consistently show that narrower lanes can reduce vehicle speeds and accidents, making streets safer for all users, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists​. This is not about stifling traffic but about creating a balanced environment where various modes of transportation can coexist safely. Contrary to the belief that these changes drive businesses away, urban design improvements usually attract more foot traffic and boost local economies. Walkable and bike-friendly areas tend to see increased retail activity as they become more pleasant places to visit and shop​. Successful examples from other cities demonstrate that investing in pedestrian-friendly infrastructure can lead to economic revitalization and increased property values. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, we also address larger issues like environmental sustainability and public health. Reducing our dependence on cars helps lower emissions and fosters a healthier community. This is particularly crucial as cities worldwide face the urgent need to combat climate change.

Regarding the fears of traffic congestion akin to the Colwood crawl, it’s essential to consider the long-term vision behind these changes. Enhanced public transit options and more efficient traffic management strategies are integral parts of this vision​. The goal is not to eliminate cars but to provide viable alternatives that can ease overall traffic and make downtown more accessible. Cities evolve, and with that evolution comes the need to adapt our infrastructure to meet modern demands. As cities grow, the need to move more people increases. If Nanaimo wants to be able to move all of its citizens in an efficient, safe manner, we need to move toward better public transit, walking, and cycling infrastructure. Unfortunately, simply funding these modes of transportation is not enough, due to two factors: the Tragedy of the Commons and Induced Demand. The first concept is well summed-up in the satirical article by [The Onion: 98 Percent Of U.S. Commuters Favor Public Transportation For Others](https://www.theonion.com/report-98-percent-of-u-s-commuters-favor-public-trans-1819565837). If driving a car is still convenient and pandered to, not only will other modes of transportation see less use and therefore less demand and funding, but these other modes suffer. A place with high-speed traffic is not safe, nor pleasant to cycle and walk in.

The second concept is an old one but unfortunately new to the fields of city planning and traffic engineering. Induced Demand is simply the idea of “if you build it they will [use it].” This is how we have ended up with bumper-to-bumper traffic on 10-lane highways in places like USA and China. People saw traffic crawling and figured that if they built another lane, that would provide more space for cars to move more quickly. They built the lane, and traffic moved faster until many people who had stopped driving because traffic was so bad saw that driving was once again a convenient option and started driving, creating more traffic until it crawled and folks thought “hey, maybe just one more lane would fix this issue?”  The unfortunate reality is that personal automobiles with usually a single occupant in them are the most inefficient way to travel. Building infrastructure that attempts to compensate for the collosal amount of space vehicles take is a forever losing battle that drains our city’s coffers, kills people, and destroys our climate and environment.

The recent filming that depicted downtown with tumbleweeds and broken windows is a temporary, fictional scenario, not a reflection of our city's potential. Embracing these changes means moving towards a more dynamic, inclusive, and prosperous future for Nanaimo. While it is crucial to address concerns and ensure that all voices are heard in this transformation, it is equally important to recognize the benefits of creating a safer, more livable downtown. By fostering a community-centric approach to urban planning, we can make downtown Nanaimo a place where businesses thrive, residents feel safe, and everyone can enjoy a high quality of life.  The concerns of the op-ed writer highlight the need for continuous dialogue, but it's crucial to look at the broader picture and long-term benefits these changes can bring to our community. Let's work together to create a downtown that we can all be proud of.
