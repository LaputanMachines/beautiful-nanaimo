**Sarah Goodyear** is a journalist and author who has covered cities and transportation for publications such as *Grist*, *CityLab*, and *Streetsblog*. **Doug Gordon** is a TV producer and writer who is also a neighborhood safe streets advocate, better known online as Brooklyn Spoke. **Aaron Naparstek** is the founding editor of *Streetsblog*, a news site that launched in 2006 and is dedicated to what was then called New York's "livable streets" renaissance. They came together to create *The War on Cars* podcast in 2018 out of a sense that no one was covering the subject of cars and what they do to culture, society, and the planet in the way they felt it deserved. Doug and Sarah continue to host the podcast and have now authored their first book together.
