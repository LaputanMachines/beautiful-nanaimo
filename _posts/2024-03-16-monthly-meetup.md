This month, we'll be talking about our current parking reform initiatives.
We'll also be chatting about the "Livable Nanaimo with Todd Litman" talk that happened earlier.

- Outline our parking reform plans and discuss action items
- Retrospective on the "Livable Nanaimo with Todd Litman" talk from earlier
- Open discussion on parking, land use, and future guest speakers
