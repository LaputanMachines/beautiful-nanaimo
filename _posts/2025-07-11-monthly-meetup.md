## About the Design Commercial Project

The Design Commercial project is a major initiative to enhance the public realm space on Commercial Street, which serves as the heart of Nanaimo. This project aims to:

- Refresh the tired public realm and create more engaging spaces
- Provide more space for people to move comfortably on foot
- Reduce vehicle dominance and create people-oriented streets
- Enhance opportunities for community events and activities
- Incorporate public art, improved surface finishes, street trees, and better lighting

## What We'll Explore

During our walking tour, we'll see:
- The ongoing construction from Wharf to Church Street (Phase 1)
- Plans for Diana Krall Plaza improvements
- Future Tideline Park upgrades
- How the project incorporates community feedback and design principles
- The transformation of Commercial Street into a more vibrant downtown core

## Project Highlights

According to the [Design Commercial project page](https://www.getinvolvednanaimo.ca/designcommercial), construction is currently underway on the first phase, which extends from Wharf to Church Street. The project team has been working to transform design principles into physical reality, with construction scheduled to continue through May 2025.

This is a fantastic opportunity to see firsthand how our downtown is being reimagined and to learn about the collaborative process that's making Nanaimo's built environment more beautiful and functional for everyone.

We'll meet by the book mural in Diana Krall Plaza and then explore the changes together. Don't miss this chance to see the transformation of our downtown in action!
