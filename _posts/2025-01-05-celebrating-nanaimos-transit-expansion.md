The Regional District of Nanaimo has announced an impressive 8,700-hour increase in annual transit service hours, marking a boost of over 5% to the region’s public transportation network starting January 5th. This development represents not only a major milestone in Nanaimo’s transit history but also a commitment to building a more connected, sustainable, and equitable community. These new transit hours are cost-shared with BC Transit and signal growing recognition that transit across the province is a growing and necessary service for millions of commuters. Increasing transit service in the region is crucial to help the City of Nanaimo reach its mode shift goal for 8% of all trips to be made by public transit by 2041.

## We’ve Come a Long Way

While Nanaimo hasn't necessarily been known for its extensive transit network, over the past decade, RDN Transit  has undergone transformational improvements. From new routes to enhanced frequency, these changes have reshaped how residents navigate the region. Over time these advancements have led to consistent ridership growth in the system, with a return to pre-pandemic ridership levels faster than many other communities in the province. Here are some highlights over the past decade:

* **Increased Service Frequency:** Popular routes have seen the addition of more trips,  reducing wait times and making transit a more viable option for commuters. These improvements have led to buses like the Route 40 VIU Express having an average frequency of 16 minutes throughout the day, and 7 minutes during peak travel times.  
* **New and Extended Routes:** Neighborhoods that were once underserved now benefit from reliable public transportation options - including links to Duncan and greater frequency to neighbouring cities. 
* **Renewable Energy:** Did you know that the RDN Transit System was the first agency in the Province to switch their Conventional transit fleet to CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) from diesel buses? This not only improves the air quality in the region, but also reduces noise pollution in our communities. The RDN is also working with BC Transit on a strategy to electrify their fleet. 
* **Improved Accessibility:** Investments in accessible, low-floor buses as well as improved transit stop infrastructure and features (such as audio next-stop announcements on all buses) have ensured that transit serves everyone, including those with mobility challenges.
* **Innovative Technology:** Initiatives like real-time bus tracking, the Umo electronic fare payment method, and digital stop displays on all buses have greatly improved the experience of people who take transit across the city.
* **Long-Term Transit Planning:** In 2022, the Regional District of Nanaimo adopted the Transit Redevelopment Strategy (TRS) which will guide transit expansion over the next 10-years. In conjunction, the City of Nanaimo supported the TRS with transit related policies in the Official Community Plan.

We believe that over time these advancements have led to consistent ridership growth and a shift in public perception of transit as a practical, convenient and eco-friendly alternative to driving.

## What Can We Expect with the New Expansion?

The addition of 8,700 service hours will further amplify these gains, delivering meaningful benefits for residents across the region:

* **Quick Connections between North Nanaimo & Downtown with the introduction of Nanaimo’s Rapid Line:** The existing Route 50 (To Downtown, To Woodgrove) will change its name to Route 1 Nanaimo Rapid Line and increase from 18 weekday trips to a total of 31 weekday trips, a 72% increase. In addition, buses will be running later on weekends which will help shoppers and commuters get home in the evenings.
* **Better Regional Connectivity:** The Route 91 (To Parksville/Qualicum Beach) will be renumbered to the Route 9 Intercity Line and interlined with the new Nanaimo Rapid Line allowing for seamless connections from Downtown Nanaimo to other local communities. In addition, Route 11 Lantzville will see additional hours and a route adjustment to better serve the community, and will be renumbered to Route 31 Lantzville.

## Building a Stronger Nanaimo

This expansion is more than just a transit improvement; it’s an investment in Nanaimo’s future. A robust transit system is the backbone of a strong town, supporting local businesses, fostering community connections, and helping to shape a city that prioritizes people over cars. By committing to ongoing improvements in public transportation, the RDN is paving the way for a greener, healthier, and more prosperous Nanaimo. As we celebrate this accomplishment, we believe it’s important to look ahead to what we can be doing next. Continued investments in transit infrastructure, fare affordability, and innovative mobility solutions will be key to ensuring that public transportation remains a cornerstone of our community’s growth and resilience.

In October, 2024 the RDN’s Board unanimously approved the Three-Year Transit Improvement Program, which includes an ‘ask’ to BC Transit to support transit expansion in the RDN over the next three years. As the TRS was delayed by two years because of the pandemic and a provincial freeze on all transit expansion, the RDN has not been able to achieve the strategies within the TRS as quickly as they hoped. However, staff and elected officials continue to support the progression of transit expansion in our community. The table below summarizes the RDN’s request for expansion in the 2025/2026 fiscal year (April 2025 - March 2026) and it is reviewed annually. BC Transit will announce which communities will receive support to expand their transit services by March, 2025.

### Proposed Custom Expansion Initiatives Year 1 (2025/26)

| AOA Period | Estimated In Service | Annual Hours | Vehicle Requirements | Estimated Annual Revenue | Estimated Annual Total Costs | Estimated Annual Net Municipal Share | Description |
|------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|

Weekday span improvements (1000 hours). |

If we want to see improvements to our transit system (in support of our mode-shift and climate goals), we need to  urge our local officials and MLAs to take the matter of increased transit hours seriously. And the best way we can ensure BC Transit supports our ask for more service hours is to increase ridership by using our ever-improving transit system. Our region cannot justify greater transit funding if we don’t continue growing our ridership numbers. While it’s not always easy or possible for Nanaimo residents to use the bus, many of us choose not to because we have convinced ourselves that it’s inconvenient or doesn’t come frequently enough. 

> "[Beyond the service strategies for the Year 1-5 period shown in these summary pages, the full TRS document also outlines improvements for consideration 5+ years from now, including additional service to VIU, new interregional service to the Comox Valley, and the potential extension of on-demand transit to additional areas of the system.](https://www.bctransit.com/wp-content/uploads/949/815/RDN-Transit-Redevelopment-Strategy-Final-Report-FULL.pdf)"

But the reality is if we aren’t choosing to use the bus today, it will not get better for tomorrow. Our system is improving every year and by using transit, you can participate in that positive change. Truly, the best thing you can do, right now, to advocate for a better transit system is download the Umo app, learn your local bus routes, and start using our transit today! Why wouldn’t you want a one million dollar vehicle driving you to work, school, or to accomplish your daily tasks?
