We'll reveal our priorities for 2024 and discuss how we can make Nanaimo a better place for people, not cars.
We'll also discus the upcoming presentation that's scheduled for March 5th with Todd Litman.
Coffee and snacks will be provided by Strong Towns Nanaimo.
**We're meeting in the Large Meeting Room on the second floor.**
